# 🛒 Basic Sales Summary from a Tiny SQLite Database using Python

## 📌 Task Objective

This project demonstrates how to connect a Python script to a small SQLite database and extract basic sales summary information. It includes SQL queries executed via Python, basic data visualization using `matplotlib`, and simple printed output using `pandas`.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python (built-in `sqlite3`)
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` for visualization
- SQLite database (`sales_data.db`)

---

## 📂 Files Included

- `sales_summary.py` — Main Python script for database creation, querying, and visualization.
- `sales_data.db` — The SQLite database (auto-generated by the script).
- `sales_chart.png` — Output bar chart showing revenue by product.
- `README.md` — Documentation for the project.

## 🗂️ Dataset

A sample `sales` table is created with the following columns:

| Column   | Type    |
|----------|---------|
| id       | INTEGER |
| product  | TEXT    |
| quantity | INTEGER |
| price    | REAL    |

Sample data is inserted into the table within the script itself.
